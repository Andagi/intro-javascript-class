# Class 2 agenda and goals

:star: This is a draft, in the draft branch! Don't forget!

## Outline / agenda

Note: Didn't list the 15 minute break below, or saving the last 5 min for surveys. Included buffer time in each time estimate below (so if I think we can do it in 20 min, I listed it as 30 min).

**Suggest everyone keep notes in a learning log** throughout the class. Show that right at the beginning of class to remind everyone; they can use my experimental little app to save their notes into GitHub, or they can write their notes wherever they prefer.

- **30 min: Everyone share one thing they tried for the debugging homework and present to the class.** Like 2 minutes per person.
  
  - I'm planning to not spend time explaining the solution in class. Instead I hope to provide a couple videos: 1) reviewing the solution, 2) introducing the Chrome debugger tool, and 3) introducing PythonTutor.com for debugging JavaScript on its own.


- **50 min: Intro to arrays and objects, as an intro to data structures and data modeling. (Ideally, mention JSON too.)**
  
  - Understand the purpose of collecting data into these containers

  - Activity (definitely want to do this!): present list of real-world examples and ask everyone to decide whether it's best modeled as an array, object, arrays inside object, etc. Discuss as a group.

  - Activity (maybe?): Have everyone search onlien for how to create an array or an object. And/or how to put an array inside another array, or object inside another object. 


- **50 min: Intro to loops, how to loop through an array**

  - Will recycle stuff from fall '17 class, because I know we did a first intro loops in about an hour!
  
  - Maybe end with activity: figure out how to loop through an array, given what you learned about arrays and loops!


- **30 min: Quick preview introducing built-in web APIs and libraries.** (We can cut this out or only do part of it if we don't have time; I'm planning to include a couple videos reviewing this either way.)

  - Activity: give everyone a snippet of code to try the Web Audio API to make the browser play a sound, and then how to turn the sound off.

  - Activity: make a web page with two buttons, one that plays a sound and one that stops it. (See fall '17 class notes for other challenge ideas!!)

  - Demo (reuse from fall '17): show how to create jQuery-like function named `$` that is just a wrapper for `getElementById`, save it in another JS file.

  - Activity (maybe?): ask students to do the same, and then ask them how to include that library into their own project.

  - Discuss/demo: what happens if you include the JS files in the wrong order? How can you use a couple `console.log()`s to confirm it's working correctly?

  - Activity (also reused from fall '17): provide a few microlibraries to check out, and ask students to include one in their project, copy-paste sample code from their documentation, and then present it to the class
