#2.1: Debugging review

## Debugging

* Remember to use console.log() *throughout *your code!

    1. Tip 1: Use it on the first line of your JavaScript file to confirm that the file is being loaded into your web page. Example: console.log("The JavaScript has loaded!");

    2. Tip 2: Log *every step* and *every variable that changes over time*.

    3. Tip 3: Write *clear, plain English *messages for yourself. Example: console.log("The user guessed this number: " + userInput);

* Python Tutor is an excellent resource for understanding the flow of your program in the JavaScript interpreter. It can also be an excellent resource for debugging your code: [http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit)

* **Preview of another tool weâ€™ll look at next time: **The debugger built into Chrome is also very useful! Just type **debugger **on a line of your code, and when you open your web page, Chrome will *pause your code* and you can inspect the value of every variable at that point in time, look at the web page at that point in time, and even execute more JavaScript in the console to test stuff out while your app is paused!
