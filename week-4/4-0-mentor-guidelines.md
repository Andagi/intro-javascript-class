# Mentor guidelines for one-on-one pair programming and guidance

First, thank you so much for volunteering to help our students for this special mentorship day! I hope it's a fun and interesting learning experience for you as well. :)

✔️ **Tasks for mentors to do before our meeting:**

  1. Read over the guidelines below to help us create the best possible experience for our students.
  2. Review [the prompts and challenges](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/master/week-4/4-1-project-prompts.md) you'll use while working with your mentee(s).
  3. Look at all the [example projects](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/master/week-4/4-1-project-prompts.md#2-check-out-our-example-projects) listed in the prompts/challenges linked to above.
  4. Please plan your visit to our meeting space in advance and aim to arrive 10 or 15 min early, so we can start class on time. Thanks!

Below are the guidelines to review for a better mentorship experience, both for you and our students:

## Our goals for this mentorship work session

  1. Provide some one-on-one feedback to our students about their personal project ideas.
  2. Help guide them (via pair programming and discussion) while they start building a feature of their project.
  3. Offer patient guidance and moral support to help students learn on their own while you're working together.

## Guidelines for our hands-on coding time

During the general feedback stage at the very beginning and end of class, that's when you'll be sharing your knowledge as an experienced programmer. But during the hands-on coding time (which will be most of the class), your job will be to act as more of a peer and ***help students figure things out on their own***, rather than explaining the answers.

  1. First and foremost, be sure to spend *more* of your time ***listening*** rather than speaking.
  
  2. When you are speaking, focus on ***asking questions*** and providing gentle hints for guidance if your mentee gets stuck.

  >The **Socratic method** is a big inspiration of our teaching philosophy for our class, where the teacher guides students to find the answers on their own by asking questions rather than giving answers.
        
  3. Act as a peer and get into a beginner's mindset. If you already know a lot, then pretend that you're learning this for the first time and act as a collaborator.
  
  4. Resist the urge to give away answers. It's *really* hard to hold back sometimes, but think of this as mindful practice in the art of being patient.
  
  5. Encourage your mentee(s) to **search for things online** if they forgot or don't know how to do something. Search for things with them and provide suggestions for which resources are good ones, and gently guide them in the right direction without giving away the answers.  
  
  6. **Write down notes** on what topics you cover together, jotting down bullet points on where your mentee(s) get stuck, what they learned, and any other thoughts you'd like to share at the end of the work session to give them feedback on how to be a more effective self-guided learner.
  
  7. Possibly the biggest way you can help your mentee(s) is by helping them build up their confidence in learning things on their own. You're there as an encouraging friend, providing moral support for surviving (and embracing) the roller coaster of emotions that come with learning a challenging new skill.


## JavaScript programming concepts and functions to use

:star: Our coding style and pretty much ***all*** the DOM-related JavaScript methods and properties we've covered so far can be seen in the code for [our very minimal Hangman game](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hangman-v0-final), so definitely review that example.

  1. Please use `let` instead of `var` for all variable declarations. (No constants yet.)
  
  2. Please only use `document.getElementById()` to access DOM elements, and encourage students to save them as variables rather than chaining lots of things together.
  
  3. Use the `addEventListener()` method in JavaScript, *not* the `onclick` attribute in HTML.
  
  4. For comparisons, use only the strict `===` and `!==` equality operators.
  
  5. Please only use the `textContent` property or basic CSS properties via `style.background` for example; we have *not* used the `innerHTML` property yet. (You can learn it together if it's required though!)
  
  6. Be sure to remind students to write comments for themselves!
  
  7. Encourage students to use `console.log()` and preemptively debug while they're working, checking the browser console periodically to confirm each step of the way that their code is working as expected.
  
  8. We have *not* looked at functions in any detail yet (nor the return statement nor variable scope), so for now it's fine if students use lots of global variables and a very procedural/imperative style of programming.
  
  9. Encourage students to review objects and arrays, and think about how they can make use of them to model the data in their app, if applicable. (We have looked briefly at nested structures, but most students will need some extra review.)
