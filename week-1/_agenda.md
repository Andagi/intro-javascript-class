## Goals for class 1

  - Build a super tiny web app from scratch, from start to finish! Understand the whole process at a high level, from planning to researching/reading documentation to coding to testing and debugging.

  - Review drawing a flowchart both from the user's perspective and from the developer's perspective (including implementation details).

  - Brainstorm specific questions on how to implement an idea with code, to practice breaking ideas down into smal steps -- thinking algorithmically!

  - Search online to find hints, key terms, and code snippets to help answer those questions.

  - Present our findings in front of the class, to practice compiling information and explaining it in our own words.

  - Discuss effective techniques for searching online, reviewing documentation, and testing out code snippets using tools like the browser console, [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), and [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/).

  - Explore the basics of the following topics in JavaScript: linking JS files to HTML files, functions, logging to the console, defensive coding/preemptive debugging, functions, the DOM, objects, events, variables, and conditional statements.

  - Practice debugging with a couple examples.

  - Write a quick learning log to review what we covered in class.


## Condensed agenda for class 1

***Note:** times are relative, starting from 0:00, since different sections of the class start at different times. And of course we may improvise a bit and probably won't stick exactly to the schedule; this plan is more of a starting point, not a strict rule.*

 - **0:00:** Intros, take a look at our app (a *super minimal* first version of [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))), and flowchart the app.

  - **0:25:** Brainstorm questions on how to build the game, collaborate on researching those questions, and then present our findings with the class.

  - **0:55:** Try out the browser console, use JavaScript to change HTML and CSS, practice with a round a mob coding, review our starter code, and do a quick debugging challenge.

  - **1:35:** ***BREAK TIME!*** Stretch your legs, jump up and down a couple times, get a snack, meditate, or whatever you want for 15 min.

  - **1:50:** Build our app step by step and introduce key programming concepts including: variables, functions, the DOM, accessing HTML elements with JavaScript, events, and conditional statements. Practice with some quick coding challenges and review solutions.

  - **2:50:** Test out our finished app and identify the cliffhanger bug! Wrap up by writing a learning log for the day.

*Optionally, stay a few minutes late for any last questions, or if we run overtime due to people arriving late to class.*


## Detailed Agenda for class 1

***Note:** times are relative, starting from 0:00, since different sections of the class start at different times. And of course we may improvise a bit and probably won't stick exactly to the schedule; this plan is more of a starting point, not a strict rule.*

  - **0:00:** Ice-breaker game (the unique handshakes problem) and round of introductions.

  - **0:10:** Introduce the web app we'll create today: a *super minimal* first version of [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)). Try it out, and then we'll flowchart it from the user's perspective.

  - **0:20:** As a group, we'll flowchart the game with implementation details (from the developer's perspective).

  - **0:25:** Brainstorm questions on how to build the game, sharing them on sticky notes.

  - **0:30:** Working in pairs, break down these questions further and search online for hints, key words, and code snippets.

  - **0:45:** Everyone will present what they found, and we'll discuss a couple tips for better Googling.

  - **0:55:** Try out the browser console and dev tools, "hack" Google, and using JavaScript to change the HTML and CSS.

  - **1:00:** Quick round of mob coding in Glitch to practice.

  - **1:05:** Brief walkthrough of starter code, ID attributes in the HTML, and linking our JavaScript to our HTML.

  - **1:10:** Debugging challenge, working individually. Then we'll review the solution together.

  - **1:35:** ***BREAK TIME!*** Stretch your legs, jump up and down a couple times, get a snack, meditate, or whatever you want for 15 min.

  - **1:50:** Quick overview of variables, numbers, strings, concatenation, plus a couple practice challenges.

  - **2:05:** Intro to functions and a quick practice challenge or two.

  - **2:15:** Intro to the DOM, objects, dot notation, using JavaScript to access particular HTML elements, and a quick note on two ways to access text within different types of HTML elements. Plus a quick practice challenge.

  - **2:20:** Quick overview to events, adding and removing event listeners, and a quick practice challenge.

  - **2:40:** Quick intro to conditional statements and comparison operators.

  - **2:50:** Test out our finished app and identify the cliffhanger bug!

  - **3:00:** Write a learning log for the day and fill out a short survey to give anonymous feedback on today's class.

*Optionally, stay a few minutes late for any last questions, or if we run overtime due to people arriving late to class.*
