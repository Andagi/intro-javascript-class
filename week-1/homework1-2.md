## 1. Create a GitHub repository for your project

On GitHub, projects are called "repositories" or "repos" for short. GitHub is a great place to share your code, get feedback on it, and invite others to collaborate on your projects!

  - [ ] Read and follow the instructions in [this help page from GitHub on how to create a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

  - [ ] Give your repo a short but descriptive name that describes your project. **Note:** The most common naming convention for repos is to keep it all lowercase, with words separated by hyphens. For example: `my-awesome-project`.
  
  - [ ] Don't forget to check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README." A README file contains general information about your project. It's a convention dating back to [at least the 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)!


## 2. Add your project planning notes

Remember those user stories, feature ideas, and flowcharts you worked on for your project? It's time to make that documentation a bit more official by adding it all to your `README.md` file!

  - [ ] Following [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change), add your previous notes and save the changes.

  - [ ] You can make the formatting nicer by using Markdown, a popular formatting language that's easier and faster to write than HTML. (It's the standard used by GitHub and StackOverflow!) See [GitHub's Markdown reference page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  
  - [ ] Upload your flowcharts, preferably in an image file format if possible. (But it's OK if you can't.) Follow [GitHub's instructions on how to upload a file](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) directly to their website. **Note:** The file size limit is 25MB.


## 3. Outline your first implementation details

Based on what you've learned so far, you can already start digging into *how* you'll start building the first prototype for your project! In your `README.md` file, write down some notes based on the following prompts. It's OK if they're just bullet points.

  1. **How would you describe the inputs of your app?**
  <br/>What goes in? What data does your app take in from the user, if any? Will it get data from a databse or from a third-party service?
  
  2. **How would you describe the outputs or possible outcomes of your app?**
  <br/>Based on those inputs, what does the app display to the user? What are some of the *outcomes* or *results* that your app produces based on how the user interacts with it?
  
  3. **What would you store as variables in your JavaScript file for the first prototype of your app?**
  <br/>What does the computer need to *remember* between when the user starts the app and when they close the page?<br/>
  
  4. **What data needs to be stored permanently, if any?**
  <br/>Which pieces of information need to be saved even after the user closes the app, so they can get it back later on? (In other words, what would you save in a database?)
  
  5. **Which kinds of data types are these inputs/variables?**
  <br/>Are they strings of text? Numbers? Boolean values (true or false)?
  
  6. **What events would you need to listen for with JavaScript?**
  <br/>Will your app need to respond to button clicks? Will it respond directly to pressing keys on the keyboard? Scrolling up or down on the page? Microphone or webcam usage? Something else?


## 4. Sketch a flowchart with implementation details

Borrowing ideas from how we made a more detailed flowchart from our Hangman game (see [section 1.2 review materials](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/master/week-1/1-2-review-hangman-game.md)), start making a new flowchart for at least part of your app that includes some of the implementation details, showing what needs to happen in the code.

**Hangman flowchart with implementation details below, for reference:**

Remember, there's *no right answer* for any of this! The point is just to practice thinking about how to translate your ideas into the more detailed steps required to bring your project to life as a functional piece of software. That skill is even more important than just knowing how to write the code itself, and it takes a lot of practice to develop an intuition for this stuff!

## 5. Build a simplified HTML mockup

Feel free to copy HTML and/or CSS from [the Hangman game](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/master/week-1/1-2-review-hangman-game.md) and modify it to start building a mockup of your project (at least part of it)!

You can make your mockup using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) or build it locally on your computer. But either way, **you should at some point upload your HTML and/or CSS files to GitHub**, following [those same instructions linked to above](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/).

  > **If you need a refresher:** Review [section 1.1 on how to use Glitch and Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/master/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md) to build projects locally.

**Some tips:**

  - The point here is just to *get started* and spark some ideas related to your project. Digging into some code, even just a little HTML, can help you look at your project from a different perspective.

  - Please don't get too detailed with this just yet. Don't worry about making it look nice. For any parts that are tricky to display on the page (like a complicated layout), just put a placeholder there like I did with our Hangman game -- I left out the picture, which is possibly the most important part of that game! But that's OK for a first prototype.
  
  - Remember, there's no such thing as cheating here -- so you can browse the web and borrow from other people's code too! 
  
  - For chunks of text beyond headings and short descriptions, just use some fake data! Try a [lorem ipsum generator](https://loremipsumgenerator.com/) to copy-paste paragraphs of text. That's what professional web and graphic designers do!
  
  - For images, you can generate some placeholder images of any size with these free tools: [PlaceIMG](https://placeimg.com/) or [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/). Or feel free to leave out all the images entirely!
