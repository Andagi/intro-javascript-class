# 1.2: Programming concepts review and the Hangman game

‚ùì **If you have any questions**, please ask on the private Slack channel for our class. (See our [quick intro to Slack](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md#111-intro-to-slack) if you need a refresher.)

:clock2: **Time to complete: about 2 hours**, or more if you dive deeper into the topics and do your own research, which I always recommend!

:books: **Prerequisites:**
  -  First review [Section 1.1: Getting started with our first software tools](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/master/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md).
  - **Two *new* videos** have been added to section 1.1: [Intro to Chrome's developer tools and the browser console](https://youtu.be/O_sJE_3jKZ4) (4 min), and [Creating websites locally with VS Code](https://youtu.be/E4FmXNatxt0) (5 min).

## 1.2.2: Linking JavaScript to HTML

How do you get these different languages -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- to talk to each other? This is a quick overview of how to set it up and a couple potential problems to look out for.

## 1.2.5: Intro to events and event listeners

:tv: **Video: Intro to events and event listeners (19 min): https://youtu.be/UbwCNBCUrhQ**

Events and event listeners allow you to respond to user input (among many other types of events), telling a section of your code to *wait* and only execute when triggered by an event. Web browsers provide a built-in JavaScript function named `addEventListener`, which is available on any JavaScript object that represents a DOM element (see section 1.2.4 above for more on the DOM).

**Example code for responding to a click on a button:**

```javascript
let submitButtonElem = document.getElementById("submit");

submitButtonElem.addEventListener("click", logClick);

function logClick () {
  console.log("User clicked the button!");
}
```

Every time you use an event listener, there are **three main questions** you'll need to answer:

  - **Where is the event happening?** On the `submitButtonElem` (the object representing a button on the web page)
  - **Which event are we listening for?** The `"click"` event (see the [list of all built-in events on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events))
  - **What should happen when the event occurs?** Run the `logClick` function


Optionally, your function can also receive an input from the event listener, which contains information about the event that just occurred! For example, the `event` parameter in the code below will be replaced by a MouseEvent object containing lots of information about your mouse clicks:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("click", logMouseEvent);

function logMouseEvent (event) {
  console.log(event);
}
```

Try running the code above (you can test it directly in your browser console if you like). Click somewhere on the web page, and then look inside the console. You should see a MouseEvent object show up in your console every time you click the page, and you can expand that object to look inside it:

## 1.2.6: Operators: Increment, decrement, and concatenate

Here's our first look at arithmetic operators and concatenation in JavaScript, which we'll need in order to count down the number of guesses in our game.
