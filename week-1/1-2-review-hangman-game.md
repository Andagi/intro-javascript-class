# 1.2: Programming concepts review and the Hangman game

‚ùì **If you have any questions**, please ask on the private Slack channel for our class. (See our [quick intro to Slack](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/master/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md#111-intro-to-slack) if you need a refresher.)

:clock2: **Time to complete: about 2 hours**, or more if you dive deeper into the topics and do your own research, which I always recommend!
